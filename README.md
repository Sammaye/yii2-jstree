yii2-jstree
===========

A Yii2 reboot of my [JsTree widget](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/jstreeinputwidget/).

Since I was in a bit of hurry to convert this I have not updated the JsTree version. It is literally a backward compatible port for Yii2.

You can download it from [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/sammaye/yii2-jstree) and you can file your issues at [GitHub](https://github.com/Sammaye/yii2-jstree/issues)
